The Ionization module will be usefull to determine the non-ideal terms. 
Bethune et al. 2017 used their own modules. 

We will use the ionization table which is based on Desch & Turner 2015. 


1) Load the data and plot the diffusion coefficients for Ohmic and Ambipolar for a density of 10^-10 g/cm^2, Ceta=1e-19, beta=10^5 for different temperatures.

2) Create a interpolation function based on the input table. 

There is a guide here but if there is a problem I can also help
https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/generated/scipy.interpolate.RegularGridInterpolator.html

The idea is to have a working routine which we can use to give it a value of rho,temp,ceta and beta and it return the value for Ohmic and Ambipolar diffusion in cm^2/s.
